Hi, i'm **3PSY0N** or **3P** !

Passionate about web development and pretty designs, I currently develop in PHP.


I still have a pronounced love of HTML/CSS and all the great things these two languages have to offer.


I'm gradually getting into VueJS, which is perfect for putting the magic together.
